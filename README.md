# Turdidae Supplementary Material

This repository contains all the supplementary material for the study "RECONSTRUCTING THE BIOGEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF THE TURDIDAE FAMILY".

## Overview

### Occurence Data

This folder contains the R script used to download, clean up and format the occurence data for all chosen species from the GBIF public database, as well as citation info and all necessary files to run the script.

### Replication Package

This folder contains all files needed to replicate our biogeographical analysis using the PhyGeo software.

### Results

This folder contains various files created and used during analysis, as well as the full extent of our biogeographical reconstruction, composed of 390 probability maps.

Inside the Tree folder, you will find the various steps of the creation of our final phylogenetic tree for the Turdidae family.

### Sequence Data

This folder contains a list of GenBank access numbers for all sequences used, and the Nexus file used for the phylogenetic analysis with its corresponding MrBayes block.
